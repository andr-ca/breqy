# Multi-Agent Coordination

Use this skill when you start work on a feature and another agent session
might be working on the same repository, or when you detect that a lock
exists for the feature you want to work on.

**`tools/agent-lock.sh` is agentharness's own dogfooding tool — it is
not currently installed into consumer projects by `harness-link.sh`.**
If this skill file is symlinked/copied into a consumer repo (the
normal case for every install mode) and `tools/agent-lock.sh` doesn't
exist there, every command below will fail with "No such file or
directory". Check `[ -x tools/agent-lock.sh ]` before
relying on this skill's commands; if it's missing, this protocol
doesn't apply to this repo yet — fall back to plain git branch
discipline (check `git branch -a` / `git log` for other in-progress
work before starting) rather than assuming the lock file exists.

Deeper reference: `patterns/multi-agent-coordination/COORDINATION.md`
(full protocol, lock format, stale detection, worktree rules).

## Before starting work: check for a lock

```bash
tools/agent-lock.sh check "add-user-auth"
```

- **FREE** — no lock exists. Proceed normally.
- **LOCKED** — another agent is working on this feature.

---

## Acquiring a lock

```bash
AGENT_LOCK_PID=<stable-session-pid> tools/agent-lock.sh acquire "add-user-auth" "feat/user-auth"
# ACQUIRED: locked 'add-user-auth' (agent_id=3f2a1c8d-..., owner_pid=12345)
# 3f2a1c8d-...
export AGENTHARNESS_AGENT_ID=3f2a1c8d-...   # the id from the last line
```

**Check `owner_pid` in that output.** It is the process whose liveness and
ancestry the lock is anchored to. If it isn't the session process you
meant, `acquire` still succeeds — and the mistake surfaces much later, as
a push blocked by your *own* lock. `acquire` prints a `NOTE` when the
recorded pid isn't an ancestor of the acquiring process, which is the
usual signature of a wrong `AGENT_LOCK_PID`.

The agent id is a UUID printed on the last line. Keep it — you need it to
release or renew.

> **Do not capture it with command substitution.** The obvious
> `AGENT_ID="$(tools/agent-lock.sh acquire …)"` records the *substitution
> subshell* as the lock's owner process. That subshell exits the instant
> the assignment completes, so the lock is left owned by a dead pid —
> observed defeating lock persistence even from a genuinely long-lived
> interactive shell. Read the id from the printed output instead, and
> pass `AGENT_LOCK_PID` explicitly.

**`AGENT_LOCK_PID` is how you name your session's stable process.** It
defaults to `$PPID`, which is right only when the caller's parent really
does live as long as the session. Set it to a pid that outlives the whole
branch's work — your interactive shell, or the agent client process
itself. Clients that run each tool call in a fresh process have no such
parent by default and should always pass it explicitly.

With a worktree:

```bash
git worktree add -b feat/user-auth .worktrees/user-auth main
AGENT_LOCK_PID=<stable-session-pid> tools/agent-lock.sh \
    acquire "add-user-auth" "feat/user-auth" ".worktrees/user-auth"
```

## How a lock stays alive (the lease)

A lock has **two independent liveness grants** and is only considered
stale when both are gone:

| Grant | Covers |
|---|---|
| **Live owner pid** | A long-lived shell; keeps working past the lease TTL. |
| **Valid lease** (`lease_expires_at`) | A session whose acquiring process has legitimately exited — stateless per-tool-call clients, and anything run under command substitution. |

This is why a stateless client no longer loses its lock between tool
calls: the lease still covers the session even though the acquiring
process is gone. A genuinely crashed owner is still recoverable — its pid
is dead and its lease runs out — just not instantly.

Default TTL is 4 hours (`AGENT_LOCK_LEASE_SECONDS` overrides it). If your
session outlives the lease, extend it:

```bash
tools/agent-lock.sh renew "add-user-auth"    # uses $AGENTHARNESS_AGENT_ID
```

**Locks are repo-wide; the session marker is not.** Feature locks
resolve to one store shared by the primary checkout and every linked
worktree, so a lock taken in one is visible from all of them — worktree
isolation must not hide the coordination state it exists to protect. The
session marker is deliberately per-checkout: it proves *this* checkout's
own session, and sharing it would let a foreign worktree's session pass
the ownership check.

**Ownership is provable three ways**, in this order: a matching
`AGENTHARNESS_AGENT_ID`, an ancestor-pid match, or the per-checkout
session marker (`.agentharness-locks/.session-ids`) that `acquire`
writes. The third exists because hook processes — Claude Code's
`PreToolUse` guard and git's own `pre-push` — run in their own process
tree and **do not inherit an `AGENTHARNESS_AGENT_ID` you exported inline
in an agent tool call**, so env-var proof is unavailable exactly where
the push gate needs it.

## When a lock exists — what to do

```
LOCKED: 'add-user-auth' is being worked on.
  agent_id : 3f2a1c8d-...
  branch   : feat/user-auth
  worktree : .worktrees/user-auth
  since    : 2026-07-14T10:00:00Z
```

**Option A — Wait:** If the agent will finish soon, wait and retry.

**Option B — New branch + worktree:**

```bash
# Get a suggested branch name
NEW_BRANCH=$(tools/agent-lock.sh suggest-branch "add-user-auth")

# Create an isolated worktree
git worktree add -b "$NEW_BRANCH" ".worktrees/$(echo $NEW_BRANCH | tr '/' '-')" main

# Acquire a lock for your sub-task (read the id from the output — see
# the command-substitution warning above)
AGENT_LOCK_PID=<stable-session-pid> tools/agent-lock.sh acquire "add-user-auth-review" "$NEW_BRANCH"
```

---

## Releasing a lock

Always release when done — don't leave locks for the next agent to clean up:

```bash
tools/agent-lock.sh release "add-user-auth" "$AGENT_ID"
```

---

## Stale lock cleanup

Locks are auto-cleaned on `acquire` and `check`. To manually clean all:

```bash
tools/agent-lock.sh clean
```

A lock is stale only when **both** liveness grants are gone: its `pid` is
dead (or alive but reused by a different process, detected via a recorded
process-start time) **and** its `lease_expires_at` has passed. A dead pid
alone no longer expires a lock — see "How a lock stays alive" above and
COORDINATION.md's "Stale lock detection".

---

## Worktree isolation rules

- **One branch per worktree.** Never check out the same branch in two worktrees at once.
- **Keep them in `.worktrees/<branch-name>/`** — gitignored.
- **Remove with git:** `git worktree remove <dir>` (not `rm -rf`).

---

## Lock files should be gitignored

`.agentharness-locks/` should be in `.gitignore` — lock files are
operational state, not committed history. The harness adds this entry
automatically when you run `agentharness init`.

---

## Enforcement — locks are checked at push time

**This section describes agentharness's own repo, where `tools/agent-lock.sh`
genuinely exists.** In a consumer project, per the caveat near the top of this
file, none of the below is real unless you've installed the tool yourself —
check `[ -x tools/agent-lock.sh ]` before trusting any of it.

Where the tool is present, this protocol is no longer purely advisory:

- Acquire a lock **before your first commit on any branch** (CLAUDE.md
  mandate) and `export AGENTHARNESS_AGENT_ID=<the printed id>`.
- The `pre-push` hook runs `tools/agent-lock.sh check-branch <branch>`
  for every branch you push: a live lock held by a *different* session
  blocks the push. Your own locks pass (agent-id, ancestor-pid, or
  session-marker match). Note that an `AGENTHARNESS_AGENT_ID` exported
  inline in a single agent tool call is **not** visible to a
  `PreToolUse` hook, which runs in its own process — that path relies on
  the ancestor-pid or session-marker proof, which is why acquiring with
  a correct `AGENT_LOCK_PID` matters for pushing, not just for locking.
- A repo-wide GitHub ruleset rejects force pushes on all branches — if
  your push is rejected as non-fast-forward, fetch and rebase; never
  force.
