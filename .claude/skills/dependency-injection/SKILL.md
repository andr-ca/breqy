# Dependency Injection

**One rule:** depend on abstractions, receive them via constructor, never create them internally.

---

## The Pattern

```python
# BAD — hard to test, tightly coupled
class OrderService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.db = Database()          # creates its own dependency
        self.email = EmailClient()    # can't inject fakes in tests

# GOOD — testable, decoupled
class OrderService:
    def __init__(self, db: Database, email: EmailClient) -> None:
        self.db = db
        self.email = email
```

```typescript
// BAD
class OrderService {
    private db = new Database();   // hidden dependency
}

// GOOD
class OrderService {
    constructor(private db: Database, private email: EmailClient) {}
}
```

## Rules

| Do | Don't |
|---|---|
| Inject dependencies via constructor | Create dependencies with `new` inside a class |
| Depend on interfaces/protocols | Depend on concrete types when an abstraction exists |
| Make dependencies explicit | Use service locators (`Container.get(...)`) inside business logic |
| Keep constructors simple — no logic | Do work in `__init__`/constructors |
| Use fakes/stubs in tests | Patch global singletons in tests |

---

## When to Use a DI Container

Use a container (FastAPI's Depends, tsyringe, Wire for Go) when:
- The object graph has 3+ levels of nesting
- You need lifetime management (singleton vs. transient vs. scoped)
- You need request-scoped dependencies (e.g., database sessions per HTTP request)

Don't use a container for:
- Small scripts or utilities (manual wiring is simpler and clearer)
- Value objects (DTOs, records) — they carry data, not behavior
- Stateless pure functions

---

## Lifetimes

| Lifetime | When to use | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Singleton | Shared state across the app; expensive to create | `DatabasePool`, `ConfigLoader` |
| Scoped | One instance per request/unit of work | `DbSession`, `UserContext` |
| Transient | Stateless; cheap to create | `EmailFormatter`, `Validator` |

---

## Anti-Patterns

**Service Locator** — business logic calls `Container.get(Service)` directly. Makes dependencies invisible.

**Ambient Context / Thread-local** — global mutable state accessed via static accessors. Breaks testability.

**Constructor over-injection (> 4 params)** — sign the class violates SRP; split responsibilities.

**Circular dependency** — A depends on B which depends on A. Refactor to break the cycle, often by extracting a shared interface.
