# Project Bootstrap

Use this the first time the harness runs in a project, or whenever the
owner asks you to set it up, tailor it, or figure out which conventions
apply here.

The deterministic work is done by `agentharness bootstrap`. **Your job is
the conversation** — the tool inventories the repository and lists the
decisions that need making; you ask the owner about them, one at a time,
and feed the answers back.

**Check the command exists first:** `agentharness bootstrap plan --help`.
If it is unavailable, this repository has not installed the harness CLI —
fall back to `tools/setup/harness-link.sh` and assess the project
conversationally rather than claiming a bootstrap flow exists.

---

## The loop

```bash
# 1. Inventory (read-only — writes nothing, safe to run any time)
agentharness bootstrap plan --json

# 2. Feed answers back as you collect them
agentharness bootstrap plan --answer rigor.tier=production

# 3. Apply, only with the hash of the plan the owner approved
agentharness bootstrap apply --answer ... --confirm <plan_hash>
```

`plan` is safe to re-run at any point. Re-run it after every answer — the
question set and the proposed actions both change as answers come in.

---

## Reading the plan

```json
{
  "detected":  [{"capability": "test", "present": true,
                 "detail": "pytest", "evidence": ["pyproject.toml"]}],
  "questions": [{"id": "rigor.tier", "prompt": "...", "default": "production"}],
  "actions":   [{"path": "ruff.toml", "summary": "Create ruff.toml"}],
  "is_resolved": false,
  "plan_hash": "..."
}
```

| Field | What it means |
|---|---|
| `detected` | **Verified facts.** `present: true` means a config file says so, and `evidence` names it. |
| `questions` | Decisions only the owner can make. Unanswered ones block `apply`. |
| `actions` | Exactly what `apply` would create. Empty until answers ask for something. |
| `is_resolved` | False while any question is unanswered. |
| `plan_hash` | Changes whenever the repo or the answers change. |

---

## Conducting the interview

**Report what you found before asking anything.** Lead with the
detections, and say plainly what is already in place — the owner should
see that their existing setup is understood, not about to be replaced.

**Keep facts and proposals separate.** `detected` entries are verified
from config files. Everything else is a suggestion. Say which is which;
never present a recommendation as a finding.

**Ask one question at a time.** Use the `prompt` text, mention the
`default`, and wait. Do not dump the whole question list at the owner —
that produces rubber-stamped defaults, which is the opposite of the point.

**Explain the consequence, not just the choice.** "Production tier means
the completion gate enforces the full coverage requirement" is useful;
"choose prototype or production" is not.

**Take "no" for an answer.** Declining a capability is a legitimate,
common outcome. Record it and move on; do not re-litigate it later in
the same conversation.

---

## Before applying

Show the owner the exact list of files that will be created, then get
explicit confirmation. Only then pass `--confirm <plan_hash>`.

The hash is what makes that confirmation meaningful: it covers the
inventory, every answer, and every action. If anything changed since the
plan was shown — the repo, or an answer — the hash no longer matches and
`apply` refuses. When that happens, **re-run `plan` and show the owner
the new plan.** Do not simply re-read the new hash and pass it through;
that defeats the entire mechanism.

`apply` also refuses to run at all while any question is unanswered, so
nothing is ever created because the owner failed to say no.

---

## What it will not do

- **Overwrite anything.** A capability already configured is never
  offered for adoption, and no action ever targets an existing file.
- **Touch your source.** Only configuration files it proposed and you
  confirmed.
- **Decide for you.** No question is auto-answered, including the ones
  with defaults.

---

## After bootstrapping

Re-run `agentharness bootstrap plan` and confirm the capabilities you
adopted now read as `present`. If one still reads absent, the scaffold
and the detector disagree — report it rather than re-applying, because
applying again will not fix it and will look like a loop to the owner.

Scaffolded configs are deliberately minimal starting points. Tell the
owner they are expected to edit them.
