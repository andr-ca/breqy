# Dependency Audit

Checking and managing third-party dependencies for known vulnerabilities
and supply-chain risks. This operationalises OWASP A06 (Vulnerable and
Outdated Components) at the dependency level.

---

## When to run an audit

- Before shipping a new feature or release.
- When adding a new dependency.
- When a CVE advisory mentions a package you use.
- On a scheduled basis (weekly or monthly, via CI).

---

## Python — pip-audit

```bash
# Install
pip install pip-audit

# Audit current environment
pip-audit

# Audit against a requirements file
pip-audit -r requirements.txt

# Exit non-zero on any vulnerability (CI gate)
pip-audit --strict
```

Fix: upgrade the package (`pip install --upgrade <package>`) or pin to
a patched version in `requirements.txt`. If no fix is available, document
the accepted risk in a comment near the pin.

---

## Node / TypeScript — npm audit

```bash
# Audit and show summary
npm audit

# Show only high and critical
npm audit --audit-level=high

# Fix automatically (updates package-lock.json)
npm audit fix

# Fix including semver-major bumps (review carefully)
npm audit fix --force
```

For CI, prefer `npm audit --audit-level=high` so the exit code gates
the build on high/critical findings:

```bash
npm audit --audit-level=high || { echo "High/critical vulnerabilities found"; exit 1; }
```

Or use `audit-ci` for more control:

```bash
npx audit-ci --high          # fail on high+
npx audit-ci --config .audit-ci.json   # custom config for allowlist
```

---

## Go — govulncheck

```bash
# Install
go install golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck@latest

# Audit the module
govulncheck ./...

# JSON output for CI parsing
govulncheck -json ./...
```

`govulncheck` only reports vulnerabilities in code paths that are actually
reachable — it doesn't flag packages you import but never call.

---

## Lock files — never skip them

| Language | Lock file | Commit it? |
|---|---|---|
| Python | `requirements.txt` (pinned) or `uv.lock` / `poetry.lock` | Yes |
| Node | `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock` or `pnpm-lock.yaml` | Yes |
| Go | `go.sum` | Yes |

**Always commit lock files.** They guarantee reproducible builds. Running
`npm install` (without `npm ci`) on a system without a lock file can
silently pull in newer, potentially vulnerable versions.

In CI, use the install command that respects the lock file:
- Python: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (pinned versions) or `uv sync`
- Node: `npm ci` (not `npm install`)
- Go: `go build ./...` (go.sum is always respected)

---

## Version pinning policy

| Scenario | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| Direct production dependencies | Pin to exact version or narrow range |
| Dev/test tools | Minor-range pinning (`^1.2.0`) is acceptable |
| Transitive dependencies | Managed via lock file; don't pin manually |
| `latest` tag | Never use in production |

---

## What to do with a finding

1. **Check severity.** CRITICAL/HIGH: fix before shipping. MEDIUM: fix
   within the sprint. LOW/INFO: schedule or accept with documentation.
2. **Check if the vulnerable code path is actually called.** `govulncheck`
   does this for Go; for Python/Node you may need to trace manually.
3. **Upgrade or patch.** Pin to the patched version in the lock file.
4. **If no fix exists:** document the accepted risk as a comment in the
   lock/requirements file, create a tracking issue, and set a review date.
5. **Never just silence the audit.** Suppressions require documented
   justification.

## Dependency ownership — trust beyond CVEs

A clean CVE scan doesn't mean a package is safe to trust. Install/build
scripts execute code at install time; network access at build or runtime;
transitive trees spanning hundreds of packages; provenance gaps; abandoned
maintenance; or high replacement cost are all real risks that CVE scanners
never surface.

**Risk-tiered ownership record:**

| Tier | Examples | Minimum check |
|---|---|---|
| Trivial dev tool | linters, formatters, CLI utilities | Pinned version? Trusted source? |
| Runtime dependency | production code in your app/service | Full ownership checklist (see below) |
| Agent-executed | GitHub Actions, plugins, MCP servers, tools | Full checklist + SHA pin + provenance audit |

**Ownership checklist** (required for runtime and agent-executed):

- [ ] Capability justification — could stdlib or existing dep do this instead?
- [ ] Trust basis — official source? known maintainer? organization with reputation at stake?
- [ ] Exposure surface — direct/transitive? build/runtime? network access? install-time scripts?
- [ ] Provenance — pinned by SHA/hash? official registry source? can you verify integrity?
- [ ] Maintenance health — last release <12 months? active issue response? plan if abandoned?
- [ ] Replacement path — can you fork, patch locally, or swap it for an alternative?
- [ ] Verification method — how will you detect tampering, unexpected network access, or malicious version bumps?

**Ecosystem notes:**

- **Python:** `pip-audit --strict` reports CVEs; separately, a source build runs the package's `setup.py` at install time (install-time code execution). A wheel doesn't, but a `--no-binary` pin forces a source build — e.g. `PyYAML` is pinned `--no-binary` in `requirements-runtime.lock` for reproducibility, which means its `setup.py` runs on install and is worth reviewing.
- **Node/TS:** `npm audit` covers CVEs; separately verify GitHub Actions pinned by commit SHA (never tag/branch).
- **Go:** `govulncheck ./...` reports reachable CVEs; `go.sum` provides provenance baseline.
- **GitHub Actions:** Third-party Actions run in CI with repo/CI context access. Pin by full commit SHA; verify code before use. Treat as agent-executed tier.
- **Plugins/MCP/Agents:** Tools running with your credentials (repo write, API keys, tool access) need full checklist + verification method (hash changes, network logs, version-bump alerts).

**Scanner evidence vs. trust judgment:**

- `pip-audit`, `npm audit`, `govulncheck`: *Are there known CVEs?*
- Ownership checklist: *Should I trust this code in my environment?*

Different questions. Clean scan + weak ownership = risky. Strong ownership + old CVE (unused code path) = documented risk. Use both.

**Real example:** GitHub Actions like `lycheeverse/lychee-action` are SHA-pinned in CI workflows, run with repo access, and don't appear in CVE scanners — ownership checklist is essential.

## Review checklist

- [ ] Lock file committed and up to date
- [ ] `npm ci` / `pip install -r requirements.txt` / `go build` used in CI
- [ ] Audit run before this release (`pip-audit`, `npm audit`, `govulncheck`)
- [ ] No HIGH or CRITICAL open CVEs
- [ ] New dependencies justified (do you need a whole library for this?)
- [ ] No `latest` version tags in dependency files
