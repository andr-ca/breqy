# Design Patterns (GoF Reference)

Patterns solve recurring design problems. **Don't introduce a pattern to a problem that doesn't exist yet.**

---

## Creational — Object Creation

### Factory Method
Create objects without knowing the concrete class.

```python
class NotificationFactory:
    @staticmethod
    def create(channel: str) -> Notification:
        match channel:
            case "email": return EmailNotification()
            case "sms":   return SmsNotification()
            case _: raise ValueError(f"Unknown channel: {channel}")
```

**Use when:** the exact type to create is determined at runtime, or varies by environment.

### Builder
Construct complex objects step by step, separating construction from representation.

```typescript
const email = new EmailBuilder()
    .to("alice@example.com")
    .subject("Hello")
    .body("World")
    .build();
```

**Use when:** constructors would have 4+ parameters, especially optional ones.

---

## Behavioral — Object Communication

### Strategy
Define a family of algorithms and make them interchangeable at runtime.

```python
class Sorter:
    def __init__(self, strategy: SortStrategy) -> None:
        self._strategy = strategy

    def sort(self, data: list) -> list:
        return self._strategy.sort(data)
```

**Use when:** you have multiple ways to do something and want to switch them. Replace `if/elif` chains.

### Observer (Event / Pub-Sub)
One object notifies many dependents without knowing who they are.

```typescript
class EventEmitter<T> {
    private listeners = new Set<(event: T) => void>();
    on(fn: (event: T) => void) { this.listeners.add(fn); }
    emit(event: T) { this.listeners.forEach(fn => fn(event)); }
}
```

**Use when:** one thing changing should trigger reactions in multiple places, without tight coupling.

### Command
Encapsulate a request as an object to support undo, logging, or queuing.

```python
@dataclass
class CreateOrderCommand:
    user_id: str
    items: list[OrderItem]

class CommandHandler:
    def handle(self, cmd: CreateOrderCommand) -> Order: ...
```

**Use when:** you need undo/redo, request queuing, audit trails, or to decouple request sender from executor.

### Template Method
Define the skeleton of an algorithm; let subclasses fill in specific steps.

```python
class DataProcessor(ABC):
    def process(self, data):        # template
        raw = self.read(data)
        parsed = self.parse(raw)
        return self.write(parsed)

    @abstractmethod
    def read(self, data): ...
    @abstractmethod
    def write(self, data): ...
```

**Use when:** multiple classes share an algorithm structure but differ in specific steps.

---

## Structural — Object Composition

### Decorator
Add behavior to an object without modifying its class.

```python
class LoggingRepository:
    def __init__(self, inner: UserRepository, logger: Logger) -> None:
        self._inner = inner
        self._logger = logger

    def find(self, id: str) -> User:
        self._logger.info(f"find {id}")
        return self._inner.find(id)
```

**Use when:** you need to add concerns (logging, caching, validation) without subclassing.

### Repository
Abstract the data layer behind a domain-focused interface.

```python
class UserRepository(Protocol):
    def find_by_id(self, id: str) -> User | None: ...
    def save(self, user: User) -> None: ...
    def find_active(self) -> list[User]: ...
```

**Use when:** domain logic should not know about SQL/ORM/HTTP details.

### Facade
Provide a simple interface to a complex subsystem.

```typescript
class PaymentFacade {
    constructor(
        private stripe: StripeClient,
        private fraud: FraudDetector,
        private audit: AuditLogger
    ) {}

    async charge(user: User, amount: Money): Promise<Receipt> {
        await this.fraud.check(user, amount);
        const charge = await this.stripe.charge(user.card, amount);
        await this.audit.log(charge);
        return new Receipt(charge);
    }
}
```

**Use when:** a subsystem has many steps that callers shouldn't orchestrate directly.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Anti-pattern | Instead |
|---|---|
| God object — one class does everything | Split by SRP |
| Singleton abuse — global mutable state | Inject dependencies |
| Premature abstraction — interface with one implementation | Wait until you have two |
| Inheritance for code reuse | Prefer composition (Strategy, Decorator) |
