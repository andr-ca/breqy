# Code Review

A systematic approach to reviewing diffs and pull requests. Work through
the categories below in order — correctness first, style last.

---

## Pre-read checklist

Before reading the diff:
- Read the PR description. Does it explain *why* the change is needed?
  If the description is missing or just "fixes stuff", ask for one before
  reviewing — the diff alone won't tell you whether the approach is right.
- Check the linked issue or ticket if there is one.
- Note the rigor tier (`patterns/profiles/` or `.agentharness-profile`)
  — the coverage and testing requirements differ.

---

## 1. Correctness

The most important category. Ask: *"Can this code produce wrong results?"*

- Does the logic match the stated goal?
- Are there off-by-one errors, wrong comparisons, or incorrect
  assumptions about the data?
- Are all inputs validated before use?
- Are edge cases handled: empty collections, zero, null/None/undefined,
  negative numbers, max values, concurrent access?
- Does error handling actually handle the error, or does it swallow it silently?
- Are exceptions caught at the right level (not too broad, not too narrow)?
- Are resources (files, connections, locks) released even on exception?

```python
# Swallowed error — caller sees success, wrong data silently used
try:
    value = parse_config(raw)
except Exception:
    pass  # WRONG: value is now unset or stale

# RIGHT: propagate or at minimum log + re-raise
try:
    value = parse_config(raw)
except ConfigError as e:
    logger.error("config parse failed", error=e)
    raise
```

---

## 2. Security

Run through the relevant items from the `security-review` skill (load it
for the full checklist). The most common PR-level findings:

- Secrets or API keys hardcoded or logged.
- SQL/shell/HTML built via string formatting with user input.
- Missing ownership/permission checks on resource access.
- New dependency with known CVEs (`npm audit` / `pip-audit` not run).

---

## 3. Test coverage

At Production tier, new code must have tests. Check:

- Is there a test for the happy path?
- Is there a test for at least one failure/edge case?
- Do the tests assert on behaviour (what the code does), not
  implementation (how it does it)?
- Are mocks covering real logic paths, not short-circuiting the code
  being tested?

```python
# BAD: mocks away the thing being tested
def test_send_email():
    with patch("mailer.send") as mock_send:
        service.send_welcome(user)
    mock_send.assert_called_once()
    # Proved nothing about send_welcome's logic

# GOOD: test the observable outcome
def test_send_email_queues_message(fake_queue):
    service.send_welcome(user)
    assert len(fake_queue.messages) == 1
    assert fake_queue.messages[0].to == user.email
```

---

## 4. Clarity and naming

Code is read far more often than it's written. Ask:

- Do variable, function, and type names say what the thing *is*, not
  what it *does* or how it's used? (`user_id`, not `the_id_to_look_up`)
- Is there a comment explaining the *why* of non-obvious code?
- Are magic numbers named as constants?
- Is the function doing more than one thing? (If yes, it's a candidate
  for splitting — but only flag this if it makes review harder, not just
  because a function is long.)

---

## 5. Design and structure

Only flag design issues if they would make the code hard to maintain or
extend. Don't redesign working code during review.

- Does the change introduce a circular dependency or tightly couple two
  previously independent modules?
- Is state mutated in a non-obvious place (global, injected side effect)?
- Is there a simpler way that doesn't sacrifice correctness?

---

## 6. Conventions and style

Check last — style is the least important category. If the project has a
linter/formatter, let the CI catch style issues; don't repeat them in
comments.

- Does the code follow the project's naming conventions (`go-conventions`,
  `python-conventions`, `typescript-conventions` skills)?
- Are imports grouped and ordered correctly?
- Are error messages user-facing or dev-facing? (User-facing messages
  should not expose stack traces or internal identifiers.)

---

## How to write review comments

**Be specific.** "This could be cleaner" is not actionable. "The `user_id`
variable here is actually a UUID string — renaming it to `user_uuid` would
match the type it holds" is.

**Distinguish required from suggested:**
- `Required:` (or `[blocking]`) — must change before merge
- `Suggested:` (or `[nit]`) — worth doing but not a blocker
- `Question:` — you need more context before deciding

**Reference the reason, not just the fix:**
```
Required: This query isn't parameterised — the `email` variable is
interpolated directly into the SQL string, which allows SQL injection
if the caller passes user-controlled input. Use a parameterised query:
    cursor.execute("SELECT ... WHERE email = %s", (email,))
```

---

## 7. Smells, Inefficiencies & Pattern Misuse

Check for these cross-cutting problems regardless of layer:

### Exception handling
- **Bare/empty catch** — `except: pass` (Python), `catch (e) {}` (JS/TS), `catch (Exception ignored) {}` (Java) — silently swallows errors; bugs become invisible. Always log or re-throw.
- **Catching too broadly** — bare `except:` (Python) or `catch (Throwable t)` (Java) catches truly everything including keyboard interrupt and VM errors that cannot be recovered from. Even `except Exception` or `catch (Exception e)` is too broad when the try block is long: narrow the scope instead. Catch only the specific exception types you know how to handle.
- **Swallowing and continuing** — catching an error, logging it, then continuing as if nothing happened. If recovery is possible, do it explicitly; otherwise re-throw.
- **Exception used for control flow** — throwing to signal a normal condition ("not found" as a raised exception instead of an Optional). Exceptions are for unexpected failures, not expected branches.
- **Missing cleanup on error** — a resource (file, DB connection, lock) opened in a try block but not released on exception; needs `finally`/`with`/`using`/`defer`.
- **Re-raising loses original cause** — `raise NewException(...)` without `from e` (Python) / missing cause arg (Java: `new MyException(msg, cause)`) / missing `innerException` (C#) — loses the original stack trace. Chain exceptions.
- **Error message contains secrets** — exception message or log line includes passwords, tokens, or PII. Sanitize before logging.

### Logging
- **Log level too high for routine events** — `ERROR` or `WARN` for expected, recoverable conditions inflates alert noise. Use `DEBUG`/`INFO` for normal flow, `WARN` for degraded-but-continuing, `ERROR` for failures that need attention, `FATAL`/`CRITICAL` only for unrecoverable states.
- **Log level too low for real failures** — a caught exception that reaches the caller, or a security event, logged at `DEBUG` is invisible in production. Failures surfaced to the caller should be `ERROR` or above.
- **Unstructured log messages** — `logger.info(f"User {user.id} logged in at {ts}")` is hard to query and alert on. Prefer structured key=value or JSON fields: `logger.info("user.login", user_id=user.id, ts=ts)`.
- **Logging PII or secrets** — passwords, tokens, full credit card numbers, SSNs, or health data in log lines. Mask, hash, or omit sensitive fields before logging.
- **Logging request/response bodies unconditionally** — request bodies can contain credentials or PII. Only log in debug mode and with explicit field allowlists.
- **Duplicate log lines** — the same event logged at multiple call depths (e.g., both in a service and its caller). Log once at the right layer.
- **Missing correlation ID** — requests/jobs that span multiple services or async steps with no trace/request ID. Impossible to reconstruct a timeline from logs without one.
- **Print instead of logger** — `print(...)` (Python), `console.log(...)` (JS/TS), `fmt.Println(...)` (Go) in production code. These bypass log level control, sampling, and structured output.
- **Overly verbose hot path** — `DEBUG`-level logging inside a tight loop or a high-frequency function. Even `if logger.isDebugEnabled()` guards have overhead at scale; log outside the loop or sample.

### Database / persistence
- **N+1 queries** — loading a list then fetching related records per item in a loop. Look for `for item in items: item.load_relation()`.
- **Loading all records** — `SELECT *` with no limit/pagination; `repo.find_all()` with no bound.
- **Missing index** — a `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, or `JOIN` clause on a column not in the index list.
- **Missing transaction** — two or more writes that must succeed or fail together, without a transaction boundary.
- **Reading stale data** — reading inside a write path without locking or version checks.

### Repeated/inefficient calls
- **Repeated API calls to the same resource** — same request made multiple times in a loop or in both a condition and a body; should be cached in a local variable.
- **Chatty pattern** — 10 individual property reads where one bulk load would do.
- **Bypassed cache** — a cache exists but the code path goes around it.

### Concurrency & shared state
- **Race condition on shared mutable state** — two goroutines/threads reading and writing the same variable without synchronization (mutex, channel, atomic, `synchronized`). Look for global/static state mutated from multiple threads without a lock.
- **Locking at the wrong granularity** — a lock that covers an entire function when only one field needs protection (over-locking causes contention); or a field read/written outside a lock that should be inside it (under-locking causes races).
- **Lock held across I/O or long computation** — acquiring a lock, then making a network call or doing a heavy computation while holding it. Other threads are blocked for the duration; release the lock before I/O or move to lock-free alternatives.
- **Double-checked locking without volatile/atomic** — `if (!initialized) { synchronized { if (!initialized) { ... } } }` is broken without a memory barrier on the check field (Java: `volatile`; C++: `std::atomic`).
- **`Thread.sleep` / `time.sleep` in production path** — used to "wait for something to be ready" instead of a proper condition variable, semaphore, or event notification. Brittle and slow.
- **Goroutine/thread leak** — a goroutine or thread started but never joined, cancelled, or bounded. Accumulates over time until the process runs out of resources.
- **Deadlock risk** — two lock acquisitions where another code path acquires the same locks in the opposite order. Establish a consistent lock ordering convention.
- **Async fire-and-forget without error handling** — `asyncio.create_task(...)`, `Promise` or `setTimeout` without `.catch()` / error propagation. Exceptions don't propagate to the caller; they may be logged late (asyncio logs them as warnings at GC time) or not at all, making failures hard to detect and debug. Always attach an error handler or `await` the result.

### Memory & resource management
- **Memory leak via unclosed listener/subscription** — event listener, observer, or pub/sub subscription registered but never removed when the owning object is destroyed. Common in frontend components and long-lived services.
- **Growing unbounded collection** — a `dict`, `list`, or `map` that accumulates entries forever (e.g., a cache with no eviction policy, a queue with no consumer). Will exhaust memory eventually.
- **Large object allocated in a hot loop** — a buffer, regex pattern, or complex object created fresh on every iteration when it could be allocated once outside the loop.
- **Closure retaining large scope** — a closure or lambda that captures a large object/array unnecessarily (e.g., capturing the entire request context when only one field is needed). Prevents GC.
- **Resource not released in error path** — file, network connection, or DB cursor opened in a try block but only closed in the happy path; needs `finally`/`with`/`using`/`defer`.
- **Returning a reference to a mutable internal field** — a getter that exposes the internal `list`/`array`/`map` directly; callers can modify it without the owning object knowing. Return a defensive copy or an immutable view.

### Input validation
- **Missing boundary validation** — numeric input used as an index, allocation size, or loop bound without checking it's in a safe range. Leads to out-of-bounds, OOM, or infinite loops.
- **Trusting user-controlled format strings** — passing user input as the format string itself (e.g., `printf(user_input)` in C, `logger.log(level, user_input)` in some frameworks) rather than as an argument. In C, this leaks memory or crashes; in Python/Java the typical risk is information disclosure or unexpected output. Always use a fixed literal format string: `printf("%s", user_input)`.
- **Path traversal** — file path built from user input without sanitizing `../` sequences. Use `os.path.realpath` / `Path.resolve()` and verify the result is within the allowed prefix.
- **Regex catastrophic backtracking** — a regex with nested quantifiers on overlapping character classes (e.g., `(a+)+`) applied to user input. Exponential time; exploitable as ReDoS. Validate regex complexity or use a linear-time engine.
- **Trusting `Content-Type` for deserialization** — deserializing a body without validating the content matches the declared type. Specific risks: YAML parsers with unsafe loaders (e.g., PyYAML's `yaml.load` without `Loader=yaml.SafeLoader`) can instantiate arbitrary objects; XML parsers may be vulnerable to XXE (external entity injection) which can read local files or make server-side requests. JSON is generally safe. Always use safe/restricted deserializer modes.
- **Missing max-length enforcement** — accepting arbitrarily long strings, files, or payloads without a size limit. Leads to OOM, DoS, or storage exhaustion.
- **Integer overflow in user-supplied arithmetic** — multiplying or adding user inputs before checking for overflow, then using the result as an allocation size or loop count.

### Dependency injection & patterns
- **Missing DI** — `new Service()` inside a class constructor or method body; makes the class hard to test and tightly coupled. Should be injected.
- **Service locator** — calling `container.get(...)` or `locator.resolve(...)` inside business logic. Prefer constructor injection.
- **Pattern where none is needed** — a Factory to construct a plain value object; a Strategy for a fixed enum; a Repository wrapping a single in-memory list. Premature abstraction is a bug.
- **Missing pattern for real duplication** — copy-paste of the same algorithm in 3 places that could be a Strategy; repeated decoration logic that could be a Decorator; 5-clause `if type == X` that could be a Factory.
- **Inheritance for code reuse** — a subclass that only exists to share code (not to express a true is-a relationship). Use composition (Strategy, Decorator, delegation) instead.

### Performance
- **Blocking I/O on the event loop / main thread** — synchronous disk reads, DNS lookups, or HTTP calls inside a Node.js `async` function, a Python `asyncio` coroutine, or a UI thread. Blocks all other work. Use async I/O or a thread pool offload.
- **Unnecessary serialization/deserialization in a hot path** — JSON-encoding and decoding the same structure multiple times in a request, or marshalling to/from a format that's only consumed internally. Serialize once at the boundary.
- **Missing pagination in data pipelines** — a background job that loads all rows from a table, transforms them, then inserts results, with no chunking. Will OOM or time out at scale. Add batch/cursor-based processing.
- **Synchronous work hiding behind async** — `await asyncio.to_thread(heavy_cpu_task)` or `await loop.run_in_executor(executor, heavy_cpu_task)` offloads to a thread pool but doesn't reduce CPU time. Profile first; CPU-bound tasks belong in a separate process or worker pool (e.g., `multiprocessing`, a task queue), not the async thread pool.
- **Re-computing expensive derived values on every access** — a getter that recalculates a sum, sorts a list, or runs a regex on every call. Memoize or cache the result unless the input changes frequently.
- **Payload too large for the use case** — an endpoint that returns 50 fields when a summary response with 5 would serve the caller. Increases bandwidth, parse time, and serialization cost on every request.

### API contracts
- **Breaking change without version bump** — removing a field, renaming a required field, changing a type, or adding a required request field to an existing API version. Any of these break existing callers silently. Version the endpoint or maintain backward compat.
- **Optional field added as required** — a new request field with no default and no null-tolerance. Existing callers that don't send it will start failing.
- **Response shape drift** — the actual JSON/schema differs from the documented shape (missing fields, wrong types). Breaks contract-test suites and auto-generated clients.
- **No deprecation notice before removal** — removing or renaming something that callers depend on without a documented deprecation period. Always add `Deprecation` header or `X-Deprecated` before removing.
- **Implicit contract in error responses** — callers branching on error message strings instead of stable error codes. If you change the message, callers break silently. Always include a stable `error_code` in every error response.
- **Silent coercion of invalid input** — accepting `"true"` as a boolean, or `"123abc"` as a number, without surfacing a validation error. Callers don't discover their bugs and the API becomes unpredictable.

### Observability
- **No structured event for a critical state transition** — a payment succeeding, an order being placed, or an authentication failing — with no log entry, metric increment, or trace span. Impossible to monitor or alert on.
- **Hardcoded timeout values** — `timeout=30` scattered across the codebase. Timeouts belong in configuration; hardcoded values make them impossible to tune without a code deploy.
- **No health-check endpoint** — a service deployed behind a load balancer or in a container without a `/health` or `/readiness` endpoint. Orchestrators can't distinguish a starting pod from a dead one.
- **Missing trace propagation** — an HTTP call to a downstream service that doesn't forward trace context (`traceparent`, `X-B3-TraceId`). Breaks distributed traces; can't correlate frontend and backend spans.
- **Counter instead of histogram for latency** — recording request count but not latency distribution. Counts tell you volume; histograms tell you p99. Both are needed for SLO monitoring.
- **Alert only on errors, not on latency or saturation** — an alert for `5xx > threshold` but nothing for "p99 > 2s" or "queue depth > 1000". The USE method (Utilization, Saturation, Errors) needs all three.

### Configuration
- **Hardcoded environment-specific values** — URLs, ports, or feature flags embedded in source code instead of environment variables or a config file. Requires a code change to point at a different environment.
- **Secrets in source code or config files** — API keys, DB passwords, or private keys committed to the repository or present in a non-secret config file. Use environment variables, a secrets manager, or `.env` files excluded from version control.
- **No config validation at startup** — a service that reads config lazily (on first use) will fail in production hours after deployment. Validate all required config values at startup and fail fast with a clear error.
- **Inconsistent config key naming** — some keys are `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`, others are `camelCase`, others are `dot.notation`. Pick one convention per scope and document it.
- **Default config values that are unsafe for production** — `DEBUG=true`, `ALLOW_ANY_ORIGIN=true`, or `DB_MAX_CONNECTIONS=unlimited` as defaults. Production-safe defaults should be the out-of-the-box behaviour; opt-in to relaxed settings in dev.
- **No config drift detection** — configuration values that can change at runtime without any validation or audit trail. If a secret is rotated or a flag is toggled in prod, there should be a record of who changed it and when.

## Approve vs. request changes

**Approve** when:
- All Required items are addressed.
- You would be comfortable maintaining this code.
- The tests give you confidence the behaviour is correct.

**Request changes** when:
- There is at least one Required finding.
- You can't confidently assess correctness without more context
  (in which case ask, don't block).

**Don't block on style preferences** that aren't in the project's
enforced conventions. Suggest them as `[nit]` and approve if everything
else is clean.
