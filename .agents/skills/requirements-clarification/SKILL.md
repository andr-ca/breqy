# Requirements Clarification

Gather requirements before writing code. A few minutes of structured
discovery prevents hours of rework. Use this skill when a request is
ambiguous, underspecified, or likely to have non-obvious edge cases.

**When NOT to clarify:** The request is a single, well-scoped bug fix
with one clear resolution. Don't block on questions you can resolve by
reading the existing code.

---

## Verify the premise before accepting the requirement

Not every requirement arrives as a conversation. Many arrive pre-formed —
a filed issue, an audit finding, a review comment, a recommendation
document — asserting that something is broken or missing. That is a
**claim**, and claims can be stale, partly wrong, or right for the wrong
reason. Check it against the current code before designing anything.

**A requirement that arrives with a proposed solution is two claims:**

1. The problem exists.
2. The proposed change addresses it.

Verify them separately — they fail independently, and the second fails
more often. A real problem paired with a wrong remedy is the most
expensive case, because the problem being real lends the remedy false
credibility.

| What you find | Right response |
|---|---|
| Claim true, proposal fits | Implement it |
| Claim true, proposal wrong or backwards | Solve it another way; say why |
| Claim partly true | Narrow scope to the true part |
| Claim false or already fixed | Don't implement; record the evidence |

**Record the null result.** "I checked, and it's already correct" is a
finding worth writing down. Without it the next person re-investigates
from scratch, and a *rejected* recommendation is indistinguishable from
an *ignored* one.

**Watch for the check that passes for the wrong reason.** When you write
a check to confirm a claim, confirm the check actually exercises what it
names. A verification that silently matches nothing looks exactly like
one that found nothing wrong — a green result you cannot distinguish from
"never ran" is not evidence.

## One question at a time

Ask one focused question, wait for the answer, then ask the next. Don't
front-load 8 questions at once — it overwhelms and produces vague answers.
Stop when you have enough to write the success criteria.

---

## Discovery sequence

Work through these categories in order. Stop as soon as you have enough
context; you don't need to ask about every category for every request.

### 1. Goal

> "What does 'done' look like? Describe the end state in one sentence."

If the user says "add search to the app" — done means search results are
displayed, or the search index is built, or both? The answer changes the
scope entirely.

### 2. Scope boundary

> "What's explicitly out of scope for this change?"

Users often know what they *don't* want but don't say it. A scope boundary
question surfaces hidden constraints (no backend changes, no schema
migration, no change to the mobile app).

### 3. Edge cases and error paths

> "What should happen when [most obvious failure scenario]?"

Pick the single most likely failure mode for the feature and ask about it.
Common examples: empty input, duplicate submission, concurrent updates,
missing permissions, network timeout, very large data set.

### 4. Priority

> "If you had to cut half this feature for time, which half stays?"

This reveals the MVP from the full vision — useful for scoping a first PR.

### 5. Acceptance criteria

> "How will you test that this is working correctly?"

If the user describes a manual test, write it down as a criterion. If they
describe an automated assertion, that becomes a test case.

## Requirements summary (write before coding)

After the conversation, write a short summary. Keep it in the chat or as
a `requirements.md` in `docs/operational/` for long tasks:

```markdown
## Requirements: <feature name>

**Goal:** One sentence.

**In scope:**
- Item A
- Item B

**Out of scope:**
- Item X (explicitly excluded by user on <date>)

**Edge cases / error handling:**
- Empty input → show placeholder, not an error
- Duplicate submission → idempotent; return existing record

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] User can search by name and email
- [ ] Results appear within 300ms for the p95 case
- [ ] Empty search shows all records (not zero results)

**Open questions:**
- Does pagination apply to search results? (unblocks: API design)
```

Share the summary with the user and get explicit sign-off before
starting implementation.

## Pitfalls to avoid

- **Implementing then asking.** Write the requirements summary before
  writing a single line of code.
- **Vague criteria.** "Fast" is not a criterion. "Loads in < 1s on a
  100-row dataset" is.
- **Scope creep during discovery.** If the user adds a new capability
  mid-conversation, note it separately and decide whether it's in or out
  of scope for this PR — don't silently expand scope.
- **Skipping "out of scope."** The most valuable question is often "what
  are you *not* asking for?"
- **Treating an authoritative source as a verified one.** A filed issue,
  an automated reviewer, or a written audit can all state something that
  is no longer true. Where the requirement came from says nothing about
  whether its premise still holds — check it, then act.
